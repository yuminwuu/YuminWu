			<h2>WHY I CHOSE GRAPHIC DESIGNï¼Ÿ</h2>			
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>
	<i>
	Because I love all about 2d design. What I am good at is illustration, I am good at illustration of various styles. But I also love typography and design, so I wanted to combine typography and illustration elements in graphic design. The main reason I like graphic design is that I enjoy the process of completing a project step by step.
